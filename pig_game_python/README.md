Overview of the game:

The Pig game is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a six-sided die. The goal is to be the first to reach a certain score, here 50 points.

The Pig game is likely called "Pig" because of the behavior it encourages—being "greedy" like a pig. In the game, players have to decide whether to continue rolling the dice to accumulate more points (being greedy) or to stop and "hold" their points to avoid losing them. 

Rules:

No of players > 1.
Roll the die. If you roll a 2-6, add the number to your turn total. If you roll a 1, your turn ends, and you lose your turn total.
After each roll, decide whether to roll again or "hold." Holding adds your turn total to your overall score and ends your turn.
The first player to reach the target score wins.

Why Python

The Pig game involves loops (for repeated rolling) and conditionals (for decision-making), which are fundamental programming concepts.
Python’s random module allows you to simulate rolling a die, giving practical experience with randomness and probability in coding.
We can break the game into smaller functions (e.g., rolling the die, checking for a winner), which teaches code organization and reusability.
